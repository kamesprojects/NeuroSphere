# NeuroSphere

NeuroSphere is a small interactive 3D web game / demo built with React, Vite and react-three-fiber.
It showcases a stylized spherical robot guide in a rotating starfield. The scene supports pointer interactions (drag to rotate) and—when implemented—mouse wheel or touch pinch to scale the robot.

## Highlights
- 3D scene rendered with Three.js via `@react-three/fiber`.
- Smooth rotation with momentum and inertial damping.
- Themed UI using Tailwind-compatible CSS.
- Modular structure with separate components, models and pages.

## Controls
- Drag with mouse / touch to rotate the robot.
- Mouse wheel or touch pinch: change robot scale (if implemented in the current branch).
- Keyboard arrows: optional rotation controls (depends on implementation).

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the browser at the address shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Project structure (key files)

- `index.html` — app entry HTML.
- `package.json`, `vite.config.ts` — build & tooling configs.
- `src/` — source code
  - `App.jsx` — top-level router / layout.
  - `main.jsx` — React entry / app mount.
  - `index.css` — global styles and Tailwind-compatible utilities.
  - `assets/3d/` — 3D models and textures used in the scene.
  - `components/` — UI pieces
    - `Loader.jsx` — suspense fallback for 3D assets.
    - `Navbar.jsx` — top navigation (if present).
  - `models/` — 3D model components and scene actors
    - `guide.jsx` — the main spherical robot guide component (pointer drag, rotation, scaling hooks).
    - `sky.jsx` — background starfield / sky rotation.
  - `pages/` — app pages
    - `Home.jsx` — main scene (Canvas, lights, Sky, SphereGuide).
    - `Game.jsx`, `Settings.jsx`, `Rules.jsx` — additional pages.
  - `lib/`, `ui/`, `utils.js` — helpers and small UI utilities.

## Notes & Next steps
- If you want scaling via mouse wheel and pinch gestures: the easiest approach is to store a `scale` state in the `Home` component and pass `setScale` to the `SphereGuide` so it can update scale on `wheel` events and touch gesture handlers. Limit scale with `scaleLimits` to avoid accidental huge/small sizes.
- Consider adding simple unit/integration tests for core UI behaviors and an accessibility pass for keyboard-only navigation.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
